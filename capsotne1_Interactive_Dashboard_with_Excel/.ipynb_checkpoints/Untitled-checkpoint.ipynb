    "1. Data Collection from various sources\n",
    "2. Business needs gathering\n",
    "3. Story building in relation to business needs\n",
    "4. Data Preparation \n",
    "5. Exploratory Data Analysis using Excel\n",

    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Project that fail to get fully funded within the time frame has higher average cost.\n",
    "- Higher project success rate in rural/ urban area, compared to town.\n",
    "- Higher project success rate on request fund to purchase necessity like classroom basics, food, sports equipment. \n",
    "- Higher number of projects posted in themonths of Aug- Oct, but project postedin Dec is having higher success rate. \n",
